### Example Test Commands

Here are some examples of how to test your LineGPT setup:

```bash
# Test sending a simple message to a user
curl "http://localhost:5000/test_message?user_id=USER_ID_HERE&message=Hello from LineGPT!"

# Test sending Chinese and other non-ASCII messages
curl "http://localhost:5000/test_chinese?user_id=USER_ID_HERE"

# Test sending a message to all registered users
curl "http://localhost:5000/test_broadcast?message=Hello everyone from LineGPT!"

# Test encoding with specific text
curl "http://localhost:5000/test_encoding?user_id=USER_ID_HERE&text=ÊµãËØï‰∏≠ÊñáÊ∂àÊÅØ"
```

Replace `USER_ID_HERE` with your actual LINE user ID, which you can obtain from the `/get_user_id` endpoint.

## What You Can Ask GPT

With LineGPT, you can ask GPT about virtually anything, including:

- General knowledge questions
- Help with writing or composing messages
- Explanation of complex concepts
- Financial advice and market insights
- Programming help and code examples
- Language translations
- Creative writing prompts
- Math problems and calculations
- Historical information
- Current events (up to its knowledge cutoff)
- Recommendations for books, movies, etc.

Simply start your message with a question or statement, or use the `/chat` command followed by your query.

### Example Interactions

Here are some examples of how you can interact with GPT through LINE:

#### General Questions
```
You: What is the capital of France?
GPT: The capital of France is Paris.
```

#### Language Translation
```
You: /chat Translate "Hello, how are you?" to Chinese
GPT: ‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰Ω†Â•ΩÂêóÔºü(N«ê h«éo, n«ê h«éo ma?)
```

#### Programming Help
```
You: /chat Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers
GPT: Here's a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# More efficient version using dynamic programming
def fibonacci_efficient(n):
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    return fib[n]
```

#### Financial Analysis
```
You: /chat What factors are affecting the tech stock market right now?
GPT: Several factors currently affecting the tech stock market include:

1. Interest rate changes by central banks
2. Inflation concerns

- Use the included `setup_webhook.sh` script
- Or manually run: `ngrok http 8080`
- Set the webhook URL in LINE Developers Console to your ngrok URL + "/callback"

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Issues

If you're experiencing issues with the webhook:

1. Make sure your ngrok tunnel is running and the webhook URL is correctly set in the LINE Developers Console.
2. Check that the Channel Secret and Channel Access Token are correctly set in your `.env` file.
3. Verify that your server is running and accessible from the internet.
4. Check the logs for any error messages.

### Debugging Endpoints

The application includes several debugging endpoints to help diagnose issues:

- `/debug` - Provides general debugging information about the application, including encoding settings and API key status.
- `/test_message?user_id=USER_ID&message=MESSAGE` - Sends a test message to a specific user.
- `/test_chinese?user_id=USER_ID` - Tests sending messages in multiple languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean).
- `/raw_message?user_id=USER_ID&message=MESSAGE` - Sends a raw message directly to the LINE API, bypassing the application's message handling.
- `/test_broadcast?message=MESSAGE` - Sends a message to all registered users.
- `/test_encoding?user_id=USER_ID&text=TEXT` - Tests text encoding and sends a message.

These endpoints can be accessed when the application is running, for example:
```
http://localhost:5000/debug
http://localhost:5000/test_message?user_id=YOUR_USER_ID&message=Test message
```

### Bot Response Issues

If the bot is not responding to messages:

1. Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits.
2. Verify that the LINE Channel Access Token has the correct permissions.
3. Check the application logs for any error messages.
4. Try using the `/test_message` endpoint to send a test message directly.
5. For issues with Chinese or other non-ASCII text, try the `/test_chinese` endpoint.

### LibreSSL Warnings

If you see warnings related to LibreSSL:

```
urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host
```

This is a warning and not an error. The application should still function correctly. To resolve this warning:

1. Upgrade to Python 3.10 or later.
2. Or, install the `pyopenssl` package: `pip install pyopenssl`
